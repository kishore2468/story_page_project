    <p>Sabari and Manikandan are two brothers, who are supposed to surrender for one of Bhavani's murders. They slip a note to an unknown J.D and later that night try to call him while he is drunk. When they are caught, Bhavani kills them and their bodies are discovered hanging from the ceiling of the detention centre classroom the next day. J.D is detained for the murders. A grief-stricken Charu admonishes J.D for his negligent behaviour, revealing that she was the one who had signed him up for the job, believing him to be the only teacher capable of understanding the needs of the inmates. She reveals herself as an NGO worker investigating the crimes occurring in the facility; the brothers had desperately contacted her for help. While in detention, J.D. discovers the brothers' note, detailing the horrific activities taking place inside the centre.</p>

    <p>J.D raids the respective establishments and cuts off the drug supply <br>to the detention facility, much to Bhavani's frustration.<br> He also sneaks into Bhavani's hideout and threatens him <br>and his men with dire consequences, while unknowingly holding Bhavani at knifepoint using<br> a ball pen. Bhavani retaliates by killing some of J.D's batchmates and ex-students. <br>With J.D incapacitated by grief, Das abducts most of the inmates,<br> intending to take them out of Tamil Nadu along with Bhavani's Benami documents. <br>With the help of his friend and expert archer Vanathi, <br>J.D defeats Das's men and rescues the children.<br> He then confronts Das and makes him realise that Bhavani will kill him because he is the link between Bhavani and<br> the crimes in the detention facility. Das reforms and transports J.D (along with the kids) to Bhavani's meatpacking plant.

        Das is then escorted by Bhavani's goons to a room to be killed,<br> but he overpowers the men sent to kill him while J.D confronts Bhavani. <br>Although Bhavani initially gets the upper hand, <br>J.D eventually defeats Bhavani by rendering the latter's right hand unusable for combat.<br> Bhavani later urges J.D to join him in politics, but J.D kills him,<br> avenging Sabari's and Manikandan's deaths. With the children safe, J.D and Das surrender to the police.<br> The detention facility is shut down by the government, with the inmates being <br>sent to other detention facilities and state prisons, based on their age. J.D, Das, and <br>the other adults from the facility are sent to another prison, where they intend to reform the inmates there</p>

        <p>Heartbroken, J.D. clobbers Bhavani's goons who had been dispatched to kill him and calls Bhavani, promising to make him pay for the boys' deaths. Having quit drinking, J.D slowly gains control over the institution and begins to reform the inmates. His actions are opposed by Das, an older inmate (found to be an adult) responsible for controlling the younger children. With the assistance of a young inmate, Undiyal, J.D discovers that Bhavani regularly makes the inmates take the blame for his crimes</p>
